    Fallowing is a way of helping people with mental health conditions gain work experience in an outdoor setting, helping their recovery.

  <p>See our FAQs below to find out if Fallowing is right for you, or get in touch if you want to know more.</p>

    <p>
      Team members who are willing and able to can work fixed hours for pay from the farm, while those whose are not have the option of volunteering to build up their experience and confidence. They may eventually decide that they would like to work for pay, but there is no pressure to either way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fallowers can work for anything from a few days to a few weeks or months depending on the individual’s needs and availability – it is very flexible. They could work full time (ie 5 days a week) or part time. Similarly, volunteers are welcome to join for as short as a couple of hours up to as long as they would like.

  <button class="accordion">Who is Fallow for?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      People who are currently out of work due to mental health conditions are expected to benefit the most from Fallowing. They may suffer from things like anxiety, depression, PTSD, eating disorders, BPD, Bi-Polar and other challenges to a mild or moderate extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them might be able to commit to working full time or part time with the right support, whilst others may have more unpredictable conditions that mean they are unable to set specific hours. Fallow is less suitable for people suffering severely from mental health conditions, who require 24 hour support. If you’re not sure whether Fallow is right for you, get in touch and we can help.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      What Fallowers have in common is a willingness to make work experience a part of their recovery.
